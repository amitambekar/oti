</ul>
<h4>Repercussions of SPAM:</h4>
<p>Across the Web, it is generally accepted that SPAM is an  inconsiderate and improper business practice. SPAM is not only harmful because  of its negative impact on client's attitudes toward the Company, but it can  also overload the Company, resources and other services.</p>
<h4>Our Providers:</h4>
<p>Since it is unsolicited, users who receive SPAM often become angry and send complaints to our service providers. It can cause negative client attitudes and drain resources. The Company strives to maintain favorable business relationships in the Web community and obviously will not allow any practice that threatens these relationships.</p>
<h4>Consequences for use of SPAM:</h4>
<p>The Company reserves the right to terminate, without warning, any IMA that violates this policy. Usage of the ONLINETRADINGINSTITUTE NETWORK system and services constitutes acceptance and understanding of this policy. The Company reserves the right to decide what it considers "SPAM", "UCE", "mail bombing", or "bulk email", and to determine from all of the evidence whether or not the email recipients were from an "opt-in" email list.</p>
<p>If an IMA or an IM's Web site is mentioned in a SPAM complaint, said IMA may be subject to immediate termination.</p>
<p>The Company will not allow the actions of a spammer to compromise the ONLINETRADINGINSTITUTE NETWORK'S IMA community. The following actions against a violating IMA shall be applicable:</p>
<ul style="font-size: 12px;line-height: 16px;">
    <li>Termination of position and Web site immediately without a refund of any kind</li>
    <li>Forfeit use of all services and products of the Company</li>
    <li>Face a possible fine of 25000</li>
    <li>The violating IMA exposes himself/herself to all civil and criminal liabilities in the jurisdictions applicable.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please Note: IMA must pay 25000 to 50000 to any of the Company's service providers, partners or individuals for excessive SPAM complaints. If an IMA is the user who is violating the ANTI-SPAM POLICY resulting in the Company having to pay 25000 to 50000 penalty, the violating IMA WILL BE HELD RESPONSIBLE AND MUST PAY THE FINE.</p>
<p>The Company reserves the right to determine what violates it's ANTI-SPAM POLICY.</p>
<p>This ANTI-SPAM POLICY and all other Compan's policies are from time to time subject to change without notice. Continued usage of the services after a change to this policy is implemented and posted on the ONLINETRADINGINSTITUTE website constitutes an IMA's acceptance of such change or policy. The Company encourages all IMAs to regularly review and check the <a href="#">www.onlinetradinginstitute.insite</a> for any changes or additions.</p>
<p>Furthermore the use of false headers in emails or  falsifying, forging or altering the origin of any email in connection with the  Company; ONLINETRADINGINSTITUTE NETWORK system and/or products is strictly  prohibited.</p>
<p>If a person or entity indicates that they do not want to  receive email, IMA agree not to send email to such person or entity. If a  person initially agrees to receive email, but later asks to stop receiving  email, IMA must abide by that request.</p>
<p>The  Company also prohibits engaging in any of the foregoing activities by using the  service of another provider, remailer service or otherwise.</p>
